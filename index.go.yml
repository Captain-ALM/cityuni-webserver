  title: "Alfred Manville (Captain ALM)"
  content: >
    <p>
    Hello, I'm Alfred Manville (#age# Years Old).
    I'm a free and open-source developer who enjoys networking my laptops together,
    writes network software to communicate between them and then tries to break said software.
    I also have a <a href="https://youtube.com/c/CaptainALM">Youtube Channel</a> which is in the process of being resumed from a hiatus.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the programming side, I know Visual Basic .net, C# .net, C, Java, Go, Javascript (Circa. 2000), Processing and Microsoft Smallbasic
    (I have also dabbled in C++, Python and Bash/Batch).
    I am currently in the progress of writing infrastructure software in Go, in the past, I wrote a command console in VB .net for my own
    pluggable libraries (I created a CMD emulator to get past the school disabling interactive CMD) and some network communication applications
    (Including a peer-to-peer VOIP client using NAudio as the audio library and my own network wrapper library).
    </p>
    <p>
    On the cracking / hacking side, I've used virtual machines a lot (Mainly infrastructure testing
    but I did at one point try creating and breaking into a test windows domain network I had setup).
    I've also used VMs to pull perform a PXE boot off a network and analyse the partially deployed image
    (And this is why the deployment servers should be switched off when unneeded, especially since PXE
    auto-domain-join would store its credentials in the image).
    I also played around with accessing the RDP servers when I was in secondary school (Turns out remote apps
    is just a glorified application auto-launcher with window size detection).
    </p>
    <p>
    I also <a href="https://subsection.captainalm.com/">bake bread</a> although this sub-site is still under construction (Mostly learnt from my grandma).
    I also play video-games and am an expert at using lower-end hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
    I used to do Karate (Kyokushin Brown Belt) and I wish I could still fit my bike.

    content: >
      <p>
      My first programming task at City, concluding the 2 week 2021 Programming Bootcamp,
      although I have only spent 3 days programming this and was a tad bit too ambitious.
      (I could have started earlier though)
      </p>
      <p>
      This Processing project show that I can use arrays, loops, mouse and keyboard interaction and geometric transforms.
      The project contains a GUI library that I made to create the menu system for what could have been the Ninjaformer game.
      </p>
      <p>
      Unfortunately, while the code for loading tile, sprite and level information exists (JSON, sprite sheet support);
      I ran out of time before the submission to actually even start on the game. But you can play around with the main code and build your own GUIs too so...

      <p>
      My first major project at City (A Java Game), concluding 2.2 Months of programming.
      This game uses the University provided game library (Which is just JBox2D extended).
      </p>
      <p>
      Looking back on this, I wish I started earlier (Like January) that way I could have implemented all the features I wanted.
      This project allows for levels to be designed within the program and allows them to be edited as XML outside the program.
      </p>
      <p>
      The code is extensible and it is relatively straight forward to implement new features. There are a few bugs that can crop up
      (Such as sticking to surfaces due to ground body updates) but I already know ways to fix them.
      This project relies on part of a GUI library I built in it and I had to modify the CityGame library by extending it.
      The audio and assets were also created by me, although they're a bit amateurish as I'm a computer scientist not an artist!
      </p>
      <p>
      This game is designed to be a story based game... The tutorial level at the beginning of the game is the dream in which the main
      character dreams of being a ninja, this allows for the player to learn the controls and basic mechanics of the game.
      The next level is the training level in which the ninja trains within a monastery.
      The final level allows the ninja to "complete" the game while exploring a set of caves.

      I may have not done any programming for this (Even though I know C#) but I helped write a good chunk of the background story
      (I also helped with the level design although it turns out 48 hours is hard to get polished stuff done in, so some stuff had to be axed).

      This project is what's outputting this page at the moment! The backend is written in Go and there is both custom front-end Javascript and CSS!
      The pages support theming and the entries can be sorted through Javascript or on the backend through GET parameters.
