  - name: "Bootcamp 2021: Ninjaformer GUI"
    content: >
      <p>
      My first programming task at City, concluding the 2 week 2021 Programming Bootcamp,
      although I have only spent 3 days programming this and was a tad bit too ambitious.
      </p>
      <p>
      This Processing project show that I can use arrays, loops, mouse and keyboard interaction and geometric transforms.
      The project contains a GUI library that I made to create the menu system for what could have been the Ninjaformer game.
      </p>
      <p>
      Unfortunately, while the code for loading tile, sprite and level information exists (JSON, sprite sheet support);
      I ran out of time before the submission to actually even start on the game. But you can play around with the main code and build your own GUIs too so...

      <p>
      My third programming task and first major project at City, concluding 2.2 Months of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
      Looking back on this, I wish I started earlier (Like January) that way I could have implemented all the features I wanted.
      This project allows for levels to be designed within the program and allows them to be edited as XML outside the program.
      </p>
      <p>
      The code is extensible and it is relatively straight forward to impliment new features. There are a few bugs that can crop up
      (Such as sticking to surfaces due to ground body updates) but I already know ways to fix them.
      This project relies on part of a GUI library I built in it and I had to modify the CityGame library by extending it.
      The audio and assets were also created by me.
