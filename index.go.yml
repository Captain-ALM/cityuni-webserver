  title: "Alfred Manville (Captain ALM)"
  content: >
    <p>
    Hello, I'm Alfred Manville (#age# Years Old).
    I'm a free and open-source developer who enjoys networking my laptops together,
    writes network software to communicate between them and then tries to break said software.
    I also have a <a href="https://youtube.com/c/CaptainALM">Youtube Channel</a> which is in the process of being resumed from a hiatus.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the programming side, I know Visual Basic .net, C# .net, C, Java, Go, Javascript (Circa. 2000 ECMAScript although I am learning the latest version of the language),
    Processing and Microsoft Smallbasic (I have also dabbled in C++, Python and Bash/Batch).
    I am currently in the progress of writing infrastructure software in Go, in the past, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/Captain-ALM/CALM-Console">command console</a>
    in VB .net for my own pluggable libraries (I created a CMD emulator to get past the school disabling interactive CMD) and some <a href="https://github.com/Captain-ALM/CALMNetLibSamples">
    network communication applications</a> (Including a peer-to-peer <a href="https://github.com/Captain-ALM/C-ALM-VOIP">VOIP client</a>
    using NAudio as the audio library and my own network wrapper library, however, it is in need of bug-fixing at the moment).
    </p>
    <p>
    On the cracking / hacking side, I've used virtual machines a lot (Mainly infrastructure testing
    but I did at one point try creating and breaking into a test windows domain network I had setup).
    I've also used VMs to pull perform a PXE boot off a network and analyse the partially deployed image
    (And this is why the deployment servers should be switched off when unneeded, especially since PXE
    auto-domain-join would store its credentials in the image).
    I also played around with <a href="https://github.com/Captain-ALM/rdpccgs-ccgsrdp-">accessing the RDP servers</a>
    when I was in secondary school (Turns out remote apps is just a glorified application auto-launcher with window size detection).
    Here is <a href="https://github.com/Captain-ALM/op_ctrl">Operation Control</a> (Stylized: op_ctrl) used for same-computer exploiting
    by wrapping target applications run by other users (Such as via RDP Remote Apps) and then starting a master server to send arbitrary
    .net DLLs to execute on the target slaved client.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also <a href="https://subsection.captainalm.com/">bake bread</a> (Mostly learnt from my grandma); although this sub-site is still under construction.
    I also play video-games (Check my Youtube Channel or my <a href="https://www.gog.com/u/Captain_ALM">GOG Profile</a>) and am an expert at using lower-end hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
    I used to do Karate (Kyokushin Brown Belt) and I wish I could still fit my bike.
    Here is my <a href="https://cdn.captainalm.com/download/keys/alfred@captainalm.com.asc">GPG Key</a> for my email address.

  - name: "Bootcamp 2021: Ninjaformer GUI"
    content: >
      <p>
      My first programming task at City, concluding the 2 week 2021 Programming Bootcamp,
      although I have only spent 3 days programming this and was a tad bit too ambitious.
      (I could have started earlier though)
      </p>
      <p>
      This Processing project show that I can use arrays, loops, mouse and keyboard interaction and geometric transforms.
      The project contains a GUI library that I made to create the menu system for what could have been the Ninjaformer game.
      </p>
      <p>
      Unfortunately, while the code for loading tile, sprite and level information exists (JSON, sprite sheet support);
      I ran out of time before the submission to actually even start on the game. But you can play around with the main code and build your own GUIs too so...

      <p>
      My first major project at City (A Java Game), concluding 2.2 Months of programming.
      This game uses the University provided game library (Which is just JBox2D extended).
      </p>
      <p>
      Looking back on this, I wish I started earlier (Like January) that way I could have implemented all the features I wanted.
      This project allows for levels to be designed within the program and allows them to be edited as XML outside the program.
      </p>
      <p>
      The code is extensible and it is relatively straight forward to implement new features. There are a few bugs that can crop up
      (Such as sticking to surfaces due to ground body updates) but I already know ways to fix them.
      This project relies on part of a GUI library I built in it and I had to modify the CityGame library by extending it.
      The audio and assets were also created by me, although they're a bit amateurish as I'm a computer scientist not an artist!
      </p>
      <p>
      This game is designed to be a story based game... The tutorial level at the beginning of the game is the dream in which the main
      character dreams of being a ninja, this allows for the player to learn the controls and basic mechanics of the game.
      The next level is the training level in which the ninja trains within a monastery.
      The final level allows the ninja to "complete" the game while exploring a set of caves.
      </p>
      <p>
      The game contains a mechanism system allowing for the unlocking of portals (Doors) for the character to progress within and between levels.
      The character contains a set of different stamina types, core stamina which if depleted causes a death, leg stamina which is a multiplier for
      doing any action that uses legs and arm stamina which is a multiplier for doing any action that uses arms. The game contains a weapon system of
      throwing stars, swords and throwable liquids.

      I may have not done any programming for this (Even though I know C#) but I helped write a good chunk of the background story
      (I also helped with the level design although it turns out 48 hours is hard to get polished stuff done in, so some stuff had to be axed).
